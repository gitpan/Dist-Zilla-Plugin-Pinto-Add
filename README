DESCRIPTION
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Pinto::Add is a release-stage plugin that will add
    your distribution to a local or remote Pinto repository.

    IMPORTANT: You will need to install Pinto to make this plugin work. It
    ships separately so you can decide how you want to install it. I
    recommend installing Pinto as a stand-alone application as described in
    Pinto::Manual::Installing and then setting the "PINTO_HOME" environment
    variable. Or you can install Pinto from CPAN using the usual tools.
    Either way, this plugin should just do the right thing to load the
    necessary modules.

    Before releasing, Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Pinto::Add will check if the
    repository is responding. If not, you'll be prompted whether to abort
    the rest of the release.

    If the "authenticate" configuration option is enabled, and either the
    "username" or "password" options are not configured, you will be
    prompted you to enter your username and password during the
    BeforeRelease phase. Entering a blank username or password will abort
    the release.

CONFIGURATION
    The following parameters can be set in the dist.ini file for your
    distribution:

    root = REPOSITORY
        This identifies the root of the Pinto repository you want to release
        to. If "REPOSITORY" looks like a remote URL (i.e. it starts with
        "http://") then your distribution will be shipped with
        Pinto::Remote. Otherwise, the "REPOSITORY" is assumed to be a path
        to a local repository directory and your distribution will be
        shipped with Pinto.

        At least one "root" is required. You can release to multiple
        repositories by specifying the "root" attribute multiple times. If
        any of the repositories are not responding, we will still try to
        release to the rest of them (unless you decide to abort the release
        altogether). If none of the repositories are responding, then the
        entire release will be aborted. Any errors returned by one of the
        repositories will also cause the rest of the release to be aborted.

    author = NAME
        This specifies your identity as a module author. It must be
        alphanumeric characters (no spaces) and will be forced to UPPERCASE.
        If you do not specify one, it defaults to either your PAUSE ID (if
        you have one configured in ~/.pause) or your current username.

    stack = NAME
        This specifies which stack in the repository to put the released
        packages into. Defaults to "undef", which means to use whatever
        stack is currently defined as the default by the repository.

    no_recurse = 0|1
        If true, prevents Pinto from recursively importing all the
        distributions required to satisfy the prerequisites for the
        distribution you are adding. Default is 0.

    authenticate = 0|1
        Indicates that authentication credentials are required for
        communicating with the server (these will be prompted for, if not
        provided in the dist.ini file as described below). Defaults is
        false.

    username = NAME
        Specifies the username to use for server authentication.

    password = PASS
        Specifies the password to use for server authentication.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    The following environment variables can be used to influence the default
    values used for some of the parameters above.

    "PINTO_AUTHOR_ID"
        Sets the default author identity, if the "author" parameter is not
        set.

    "PINTO_USERNAME"
        Sets the default username, if the "username" parameter is not set.

RELEASING TO MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES
    You can release your distribution to multiple repositories by specifying
    multiple values for the "root" attribute in your dist.ini file. In that
    case, the remaining attributes (e.g. "stack", "author", "authenticate")
    will apply to all the repositories.

    However, the recommended way to release to multiple repositories is to
    have multiple "[Pinto::Add]" blocks in your dist.ini file. This allows
    you to set attributes for each repository independently (at the expense
    of possibly having to duplicating some information).

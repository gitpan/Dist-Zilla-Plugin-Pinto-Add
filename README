DESCRIPTION
    "Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Pinto::Add" is a release-stage plugin that will
    add your distribution to a local or remote Pinto repository.

    IMPORTANT: You'll need to install Pinto, or Pinto::Remote, or both,
    depending on whether you're going to release to a local or remote
    repository. Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Pinto::Add does not explicitly depend
    on either of these modules, so you can decide which one you want without
    being forced to have a bunch of other modules that you won't use.

    Before releasing, Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Pinto::Add will check if the
    repository is responding. If not, you'll be prompted whether to abort
    the rest of the release.

CONFIGURATION
    The following parameters can be set in the dist.ini file for your
    distribution:

    root = REPOSITORY
        This identifies the root of the Pinto repository you want to release
        to. If "REPOSITORY" looks like a URL (i.e. starts with "http://")
        then your distribution will be shipped with Pinto::Remote.
        Otherwise, the "REPOSITORY" is assumed to be a path to a local
        repository directory. In that case, your distribution will be
        shipped with Pinto.

        At least one "root" is required. You can release to multiple
        repositories by specifying the "root" attribute multiple times. If
        any of the repositories are not responding, we will still try to
        release to the rest of them (unless you decide to abort the release
        altogether). If none of the repositories are responding, then the
        entire release will be aborted. Any errors returned by one of the
        repositories will also cause the rest of the release to be aborted.

    author = NAME
        This specifies your identity as a module author. It must be
        alphanumeric characters (no spaces) and will be forced to UPPERCASE.
        If you do not specify one, it defaults to either your PAUSE ID (if
        you have one configured elsewhere) or your current username.

    norecurse = 0|1
        If true, prevents Pinto from recursively importing all the
        distributions required to satisfy the prerequisites for the
        distribution you are adding. Default is false.

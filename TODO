WRITE SOME TESTS!

This distribution has *zero* tests.  A nice functional test would
construct a temporary local repository (using Pinto::Tester) and then
use a minimal distribution (with Pinto::Add in its dist.ini) that
would ship itself to the repository.

Unfortunately, that would make this plugin dependent on the entire
Pinto core.  But it's only a build-time dependency, so that isn't too
bad.  You could also construct a similar test using Pinto::Remote.
But since they are *supposed* to have the same API, such a test might
not be worth the hassle.

Be sure to look at Dist::Zilla::Tester for some ideas.  It currently
has no documentation, so you'll need to look at the code and test
scripts for a clue on how to use it.
